**Background**


_______________________________

To prepare for a vacation in checking the weather to properly pack is essential.  By looking at a dataset of temperature and precipitation observations from Honolulu, Hawaii, planning this dream vacation will be a breeze.  

Through SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib, build a Flask API capable of returning Precipitation, Temperature, and Station Locations.  The Flask API will also return average temperatures, as well as the minimum and maximum temperatures for a date range given.

_______________________________
**Objective**

  * Precipitation Analysis:
    * Query the last 12 months of precipitation data from the last date in the dataset
    * Plot the results
  * Station Analysis:
    * Query to find the station with most observations recorded
    * Create a histogram
  * Create Flask API with end routes based on the queries developed
  * Additional Temperature Analysis:
    * Calculate and plot the average temperature for the same time period a year prior to the vacation date.
    * Calculate the average rainfall for the same time period a year prior to the vacation date.
    * Create an area plot for the daily norms for temperature during the range of vacation dates.
